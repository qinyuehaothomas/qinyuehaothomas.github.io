# Day 1
After resting ~~g88ning~~ for 4 days, It's time to gte back to work

Tried Tailwind standalone CLI at v4.1.8, most tutorials were on v3 or NPM, so it took a bit of trial and error.

Spent a **massive amount of time to make a navigation bar**

# Day 2
Had Onearena, spent some time to make the typing animation
the cursor is a blinking right borderðŸ¤£
the text is added one by one using js

Deepseek told me to use `requestanimationframe()` for better performance

Problem: Tailwind only "prepare" classes that are in the static html document,
so **those utility classes that were not in the static html will not be prepared**

# Day 3
Workaround (from stackoverflow):
- Safelist in config file
- Create emity element with these classes
- Directly edit css atrribute (I went with this)

After contemplating, decided on using Image gltich as transition
because miku's color scheme makes me think of glitch
Tutorial link: [https://muffinman.io/blog/css-image-glitch/](https://muffinman.io/blog/css-image-glitch/)

Aspect ratio of image seems to be a pretty big issue.. So when render , need to crop the images into specific aspect raios.

Then it is the positioning issue on the index page.
ATP i just give up making glitches.

**Fixed it by using normal CSS `clip-path:polygon();`**
It:
- Keeps the image's size, so no need to offset
- allows `object-fit:cover;` , so image can automatically adjust size without squashing
- Allow percentage, so no need to calcluate pixels


Image type plz standardise to .png

The *titles* variable might want to move outside as a json file?

Have to create a new repo because neevr gitignore tailwind.exe....
/_ \

# Day 4
Pulled off a all nighter i dont know what for
But anyways the glitch effect is up and I think its quite cool 

Fine-tune the glitch effect (what for bro)
added icon?

Time to write some content i guess?

**Future Problem: Image is loading everytime image switches, need cache.**

did some work on the compiler?

**For Compilier, Definitely want to make a "walk" decorator for different types of operations**
